# XS PDF ASSISTANT üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è

A desktop application built with Python and Tkinter (using ttk themes) for splitting and merging specific page ranges from a source PDF into multiple, organized output PDF files.

## Features

*   **Source & Destination:** Select a source PDF file and a destination folder for output.
*   **Group-Based Output:** Define "Groups", where each group corresponds to one output PDF file.
*   **Part Definition:** Within each group, define "Parts" specifying the start and end page numbers from the source PDF to include.
*   **Editing:**
    *   Double-click group or part names to rename them.
    *   Single-click the "Page D√©but" or "Page Fin" columns for a part to edit the page numbers.
    *   Contextual "‚úì" icon appears next to the edited cell for saving (or press Enter/click away). Escape cancels.
*   **Organization:**
    *   **Add:** Add new Groups and Parts easily.
    *   **Duplicate:** Duplicate selected groups (including their parts) or individual parts.
    *   **Move Between Groups:** Select a part, click "‚û°Ô∏è D√©placer Partie", select the target group, and click "‚úÖ Confirmer Destination".
    *   **Reorder Parts:** Select a part and use the "‚Üë" and "‚Üì" buttons to change its order within its group (this affects the order pages are added to the output PDF).
    *   **Delete:** Remove selected groups or parts.
    *   **Reset:** Clear the entire configuration (groups, parts, source/destination paths).
*   **Processing:**
    *   "üöÄ Lancer Traitement" button processes the defined structure, reading pages from the source PDF and writing them to the corresponding group output files.
    *   Handles existing output files by prompting the user whether to overwrite.
    *   Provides success or error/warning feedback upon completion.
*   **Convenience:**
    *   "‚ÜóÔ∏è" button to quickly open the selected output destination folder.
    *   Uses themed widgets (`ttkthemes`) for a potentially better look and feel if the library is installed.
    *   Includes a custom application icon.

## Requirements

*   **Python:** 3.7 or higher recommended.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `pypdf`: For reading and writing PDF files.
    *   `ttkthemes` (Optional): For improved widget styling. The application will fall back to standard ttk themes if not installed.
